# Vault Security Playbook

## 1. Scope and Goal

This document is for platform engineers, security engineers, and service owners who run Vault in Kubernetes-based environments.

## 2. Security of Vault Itself

### 2.1 Cluster and network hardening

- Run Vault in HA mode.
- Restrict inbound access to Vault listeners with Kubernetes NetworkPolicy and perimeter firewall rules.
- Limit outbound access from Vault pods to required backends only (KMS/HSM, storage, auth dependencies).
- Enforce TLS for client traffic and intra-cluster traffic.
- Keep Vault version current and follow a regular patch window.

### 2.1.1 Vault server/runtime hardening for Kubernetes

Treat Vault as a tier-0 service. Kubernetes makes operation easier, but it does not remove the need to harden the Vault process, pod, and nodes.

Pod and process baseline:
- run Vault as a dedicated unprivileged user (`runAsNonRoot: true`, fixed non-zero `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup`);
- set `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`, and drop unnecessary Linux capabilities;
- do not run Vault with a shell/debug sidecar, package manager, or general-purpose troubleshooting container in live environments;
- restrict writable paths to the minimum required runtime, data, and audit-log locations; Vault's service account must not be able to overwrite the Vault binary or configuration;
- deny `exec` and ephemeral containers for Vault pods except approved break-glass roles with audit logging and short expiry;
- keep Vault pods on dedicated or tightly isolated nodes where feasible; if full single tenancy is not possible, document the co-tenancy risk and isolate with node pools, taints/tolerations, runtime policy, NetworkPolicy, and restricted admin access.

Node and OS baseline:
- disable swap for nodes that run Vault, or use an equivalent node profile that prevents sensitive Vault memory from being paged to disk;
- disable core dumps for the Vault process/node profile; on Linux this normally means `RLIMIT_CORE=0` or an equivalent systemd/container-runtime control;
- restrict host access: no broad `hostPath`, no runtime socket mounts, no host namespaces, no privileged mode;
- limit node-level SSH/debug access and require central logging instead of ad hoc shell access.

Required evidence:
- deployed StatefulSet/Pod security context and admission policy result;
- node pool or scheduling policy showing Vault isolation assumptions;
- evidence that swap and core dumps are disabled or an explicit exception with compensating controls;
- proof that Vault pods cannot be modified with `exec`/ephemeral debug by normal operator roles.

### 2.2 Seal/unseal and key custody

- Prefer auto-unseal with cloud KMS or HSM.
- If Shamir unseal is used, define M-of-N quorum, named key custodians, and recovery steps.
- Store unseal material outside day-to-day operator access.
- Test recovery and unseal procedures at least quarterly.

### 2.3 Administrative model

- Root token is break-glass only.
- Day-to-day admin tasks use named identities through OIDC/SSO with MFA.
- Split privileges between platform admin, security admin, and emergency admin.
- Policy changes and auth-mount changes require review and audit traceability.

### 2.4 Auth methods and trust boundaries

- Kubernetes auth for in-cluster workloads.
- OIDC for humans.
- JWT/OIDC for CI pipelines.
- AppRole only where stronger identity attestation is not available.

Kubernetes auth minimums:

- Bind roles to exact `serviceAccount` and namespace.
- Set and validate `audience` for Kubernetes auth roles. `bound_audiences` is the JWT/OIDC auth role parameter; do not use it in Kubernetes auth role examples.
- Keep `alias_name_source=serviceaccount_uid` for Kubernetes auth roles unless there is an approved reason to use `serviceaccount_name`. Name-based aliases tolerate ServiceAccount deletion and recreation worse, so they require strict ServiceAccount creation controls and separate risk acceptance.
- Do not make a long-lived reviewer JWT the default TokenReview strategy. If Vault runs inside Kubernetes, prefer the Vault pod's local service account token or the client JWT pattern; a long-lived reviewer token is acceptable only as an exception with owner, rotation, RBAC scope, and review expiry.
- Use explicit Vault token parameters instead of generic "short-lived" wording:
  - `token_ttl`: `15m` default for workload login tokens
  - `token_max_ttl`: `<=1h` for non-renewable workload tokens
  - `token_period`: only for periodic long-running workload tokens, with explicit role owner, renewal monitoring, and incident revocation path
  - `token_explicit_max_ttl`: set when the role needs a hard cap that renewal cannot exceed
  - Human/admin token TTL belongs to the OIDC/SSO auth method policy: `<=1h`, no non-expiring admin tokens
- Prefer non-renewable short-lived tokens for jobs and restartable services where re-authentication is cheap.
- Treat periodic tokens as an exception path: use `token_period <=15m`, renewal failure alerting, and `token_explicit_max_ttl <=24h` unless a documented platform exception explains why the token must remain renewable indefinitely.
- Do not use periodic tokens for human or administrator sessions.
- Avoid wildcard role bindings.

Example Kubernetes auth role:

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/payments-api-prod \
  bound_service_account_names=payments-api \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=prod-payments \
  audience=vault \
  token_policies=payments-api-prod \
  token_ttl=15m \
  token_max_ttl=1h
```

### 2.5 Audit and detection

- Enable Vault audit devices before onboarding live workloads.
- Write audit logs to durable and access-controlled sinks.
- Enable at least two audit devices where operationally feasible. If only one audit sink is used, record the availability risk explicitly: Vault can refuse requests when all enabled audit devices are unable to write.
- Monitor audit device health, write failures, disk/backpressure signals, and sink reachability.
- Alert on unusual auth failures, policy changes, and sudden read-volume spikes.
- Correlate Vault audit events with Kubernetes audit logs and runtime telemetry.
- Restrict access to audit logs. Vault hashes sensitive values in audit entries, but audit logs still contain high-value metadata and may include non-hashed request headers unless explicitly configured.

### 2.6 Operational resilience

- Keep encrypted backups and verify restore procedures.
- Run failover and disaster recovery exercises with explicit RTO/RPO targets.
- Capacity test authentication bursts (node restarts, mass pod rollouts).

## 3. Security of Secrets

### 3.1 Data model and ownership

- Assign an owner for each secret path.
- Store only secret data; do not use Vault as a general data store.
- Classify secrets by impact (for example: customer data path access, payment access, internal-only).
- Tie each class to TTL and rotation requirements.

Baseline secret classes (minimum):
- Critical (payments, live DB admin, signing material):
  - Dynamic lease TTL: `5-15m`
  - Max TTL: `<=1h`
  - Static secret rotation: every `30d`
  - Revoke SLA during incident: `<=15m`
- High (service-to-service live-environment credentials):
  - Dynamic lease TTL: `15-30m`
  - Max TTL: `<=4h`
  - Static secret rotation: every `60d`
  - Revoke SLA during incident: `<=30m`
- Recommended (internal non-critical automation):
  - Dynamic lease TTL: `30-60m`
  - Max TTL: `<=8h`
  - Static secret rotation: every `90d`
  - Revoke SLA during incident: `<=60m`

### 3.2 Prefer dynamic secrets

Use dynamic engines whenever available (database, cloud, broker credentials).
- Issue short-lived credentials.
- Renew only while workload is healthy.
- Revoke leases immediately for decommissioned workloads or incidents.

Operational commands:

```bash
vault lease lookup <lease_id>
vault lease revoke <lease_id>
vault lease revoke -prefix database/creds/payments-ro
```

### 3.3 Static secret controls

If static secrets are unavoidable:
- Define rotation cadence (for example 30/60/90 days by class).
- Use overlapping rollout (new value live, app switched, old value revoked).
- Rotation overlap window must be explicit:
  - default `30m`
  - maximum `24h` (requires exception approval)
- Keep emergency rotation runbooks for every critical secret class.

### 3.4 Policy boundaries for secret access

- Separate `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` paths.
- Separate services by path and policy.
- Grant only required capabilities on exact paths (capabilities depend on the specific secret engine and path semantics; do not treat `read`, `list`, `update` as a universal default set).

Reject patterns like broad shared policy scopes:

```hcl
path "kv/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

### 3.5 PKI: issuance, rotation, revocation

- Keep root CA offline or heavily restricted.
- Issue service certificates from intermediates.
- Restrict PKI roles by domain, SAN rules, key type, and TTL.
- Rotate certificates before expiry through automation.

Compromise response for certificates:
1. Revoke by serial number.
2. Confirm CRL/OCSP publication and downstream consumption.
3. Re-issue certificate and redeploy affected workload.
4. Investigate usage from audit evidence.

Operational commands:

```bash
vault write pki_int/revoke serial_number="39:dd:2e:..."
vault read pki_int/crl
vault write pki_int/tidy tidy_cert_store=true tidy_revoked_certs=true safety_buffer=72h
```

Important: revocation works only where relying systems actually validate CRL/OCSP.

### 3.6 Token hygiene

- Do not keep long-lived broad tokens.
- Do not create orphan tokens for workloads unless parent revocation semantics are explicitly unwanted and the runbook includes revoke-by-accessor or revoke-by-path evidence.
- Revoke tokens for offboarded users/services immediately.
- Use accessors in incident workflows to avoid exposing full token values.

```bash
vault token lookup <token>
vault token revoke <token>
vault token revoke -accessor <accessor>
```

## 4. Application Secret Handling

### 4.1 Integration patterns

Use one approved pattern per workload and document why it was chosen.

This section compares ways to deliver secrets from Vault. It does not mean Vault is mandatory for every Kubernetes secret; the decision between native Kubernetes Secret, sync-based delivery, and file-only external secret manager delivery is covered in the [Kubernetes Secrets playbook](../../kubernetes/secrets/playbook.en.md).

Pattern A (preferred): Vault Agent Injector
- Secrets rendered into files at runtime.
- Works well for apps that support reload/restart on change.
- Avoids storing runtime secret values in Kubernetes Secret objects.

Pattern B: Secrets Store CSI Driver (Vault provider)
- Mounts secrets as files via CSI.
- Use when teams already depend on CSI volume workflows.
- Avoid syncing into Kubernetes Secret unless there is a hard compatibility requirement.

Pattern C: External Secrets Operator
- Use when application or platform constraints require Kubernetes Secret objects.
- Treat this as higher exposure than file-only delivery.
- Require etcd encryption at rest and strict RBAC.

### 4.2 Minimal Injector example

The Vault Agent Injector mutates the Pod and mounts its own shared memory volume at `/vault/secrets` by default. Do not add a manual `emptyDir` or application `volumeMount` for that path unless you have a tested custom injector configuration; otherwise the example can conflict with the mutation or hide how the injector actually works.

This example disables the default Kubernetes API-audience ServiceAccount token mount and uses a dedicated projected ServiceAccount token with `audience: vault`. Vault Agent's Kubernetes auth token path is configured to read only that projected token. Keep it short-lived and aligned with the Vault Kubernetes auth role `audience`.

The application container must not mount the projected Vault login token. It should read only rendered secret files from `/vault/secrets`; otherwise a compromised application process can use the projected JWT to authenticate to Vault directly under the workload role.

          {{- end -}}
        # If Vault is reached through a non-default service or private CA, also set:
        # vault.hashicorp.com/service: "https://vault.vault.svc:8200"
        # vault.hashicorp.com/tls-secret: "vault-ca"
        # vault.hashicorp.com/tls-server-name: "vault.vault.svc"
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: payments-api
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
      volumes:
        - name: vault-token
          projected:
            sources:
              - serviceAccountToken:
                  path: token
                  audience: vault
                  expirationSeconds: 600
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: ghcr.io/example/payments-api:1.0.0@sha256:<digest>
          securityContext:
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

The tag in `tag@sha256` is for readability. Live admission/deploy policy must enforce the digest as the immutable artifact identity.

Verification:
- `kubectl exec deploy/payments-api -n prod-payments -c app -- ls /var/run/secrets/vaultprojected` must fail or return `not found`.
- Vault Agent auto-auth must still succeed, and `/vault/secrets/app-config.env` must be present in the application container after injection.
- Deployment policy must reject the same manifest if the image is changed to a tag-only reference.

### 4.3 Application contract

Each service must define and test:
- Where secret files are read from.
- How rotation is applied (live reload, SIGHUP, or controlled restart).
- How startup fails safely if secret retrieval is unavailable.
- How logs and metrics avoid leaking secret values.

Runtime behavior during Vault outage must be explicit for already-running pods:
- Define per secret class whether the service fails closed or uses bounded stale credentials.
- If stale credentials are allowed, maximum stale window must be documented:
  - Critical: `0m` (fail closed)
  - High: `<=15m`
  - Recommended: `<=60m`
- After stale window expiry, pod must fail readiness and be restarted only after secret retrieval recovers.
- Rotation operations must stop automatically if Vault health is degraded to avoid split-brain credentials.

### 4.4 CI/CD boundary

- CI can deploy and configure, but runtime secret reads belong to workload identity.
- Do not bake secret values into images, Helm values files, or generated manifests.
- Do not pass secrets through pipeline logs or artifact storage.

### 4.5 Rotation playbook for service teams

1. Write new secret version in Vault.
2. Trigger rollout or reload.
3. Validate health and downstream connectivity with new value.
4. Revoke or delete old credential after overlap window closes.
5. Verify no active leases remain for old credential after revocation SLA window.

### 4.6 Common mistakes in applications

- Reading secrets only once at boot when TTL is shorter than pod lifetime.
- Using environment variables for high-value long-lived secrets.
- Sharing one Vault role across unrelated services.
- Skipping failure-path testing for Vault outages.

## 5. Incident Actions

### 5.1 Suspected workload token theft

1. Revoke token/accessor and active leases.
2. Tighten or disable affected role.
3. Rotate related secrets.
4. Redeploy workload with reviewed policy.

### 5.2 Suspected secret exfiltration

1. Identify impacted paths and owners.
2. Rotate by secret class.
3. Increase monitoring for replay and lateral movement.
4. Build timeline from Vault and Kubernetes audit trails.

### 5.3 Compromised CI identity

1. Disable CI auth role/mount.
2. Revoke CI-issued tokens and leases by prefix.
3. Rotate all secrets accessed by that CI scope.
4. Re-enable with narrowed policy and stronger identity constraints.

## 6. Release Sign-off Checklist

- Vault admin model excludes root token from routine work.
- Roles are tightly bound to workload identity (`serviceAccount`, namespace, audience).
- Kubernetes auth uses `alias_name_source=serviceaccount_uid`, and reviewer JWT strategy does not depend on a non-expiring ServiceAccount token without an exception.
- Policy scopes are explicit by environment and service.
- Secret class ownership, TTL, and rotation cadence are documented.
- Certificate revocation is tested end-to-end (issuer to relying service).
- Application secret reload behavior is tested in staging.
- Audit logging and alerting are active and reviewed.
- Backup restore and DR exercises are current.
