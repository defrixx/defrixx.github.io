# Kubernetes Seccomp Review Checklist

## 1. Scope and Security Objective

Use this checklist to verify whether seccomp is applied **correctly, realistically, and safely** for Kubernetes workloads.

### Objective

Seccomp is used to:
- reduce reachable kernel attack surface;
- block clearly dangerous syscalls;
- constrain syscall surface per workload where operationally justified.

### Non-objectives

Seccomp is **not**:
- a complete sandbox;
- a substitute for runtime isolation;
- a substitute for dropping excessive Linux capabilities;
- proof of security just because a profile exists in YAML.

Note: seccomp is one layer. User namespaces do not replace seccomp; review syscall surface and capabilities independently. Validate other hardening layers using the dedicated pod security and container escape/capability abuse checklists:
- [kubernetes/pod-security/playbook.en.md](../pod-security/playbook.en.md)
- [kubernetes/container-escape-capability-abuse/overview.en.md](../container-escape-capability-abuse/overview.en.md)

---

## 2. Baseline Questions Before Review

Before reviewing a profile, confirm:
- seccomp is enabled for the workload;
- profile scope is correct (Pod or Container);
- profile source is runtime default, custom, or auto-generated;
- runtime in use (`Docker/Moby`, `containerd/runc`, other);
- target architectures (`x86_64`, `x86`, `x32`, `arm64`, others);
- granted Linux capabilities;
- whether the workload truly needs advanced kernel interaction.

The real security effect depends on runtime behavior, architecture coverage, and capabilities, not only static JSON/YAML.

---

## 3. Design Principles

### 3.1 Block dangerous first

Review priority should be:
- remove known high-risk syscalls first;
- then reduce additional syscall surface where justified;
- avoid replacing threat modeling with mechanical "block everything not seen in trace".

### 3.2 Design per workload

The team should explicitly define:
- why this workload needs seccomp;
- which attack classes are reduced;
- which operational tradeoffs are accepted.

---

## 4. Profile Source and Generation Quality

### 4.1 Auto-generated profiles require manual curation

If a profile came from tracing/tooling (SPO, eBPF tracers, ptrace/strace-like, OCI/runtime tracing), manual syscall review is mandatory before approval.

### 4.2 Do not assume trace completeness

Account for:
- different tracing layers producing different syscall sets;
- runtime setup syscalls contaminating traces;
- identical code generating different traces across libc, kernel, build, and runtime conditions.

### 4.3 Separate app signal from platform noise

Check whether syscall entries came from:
- `containerd` / `containerd-shim` / `runc`;
- init containers / sidecars;
- CNI and secret injection workflows;
- storage mount paths;
- the profiling tool itself.

---

## 5. Scope of Application: Pod vs Container

### 5.1 Verify actual attachment scope

Confirm where the profile is applied:
- Pod security context;
- Container security context.

### 5.2 Prefer container-specific profiles when behavior differs

Pod-wide profiles are often over-broad when a Pod includes init/sidecar containers or mixed responsibilities.

---

## 6. High-Risk Syscalls and Bypass Combos

Review allowed syscalls and combinations as one risk surface, not line by line.

### 6.1 Tier 1 (default fail without exceptional justification)

These should be disallowed by default:
- `bpf`
- `ptrace`
- `kexec_load`
- `kexec_file_load`
- `init_module`
- `finit_module`
- `delete_module`

If any are allowed, require explicit justification, security sign-off, compensating controls, owner, and review expiry.

### 6.2 Tier 2 (significant risk, strong justification required)

Carefully justify:
- `io_uring_setup`, `io_uring_enter`, `io_uring_register`
- `perf_event_open`
- `mount`
- `unshare`
- `clone`, `clone3` only when used with namespace-creating flags or when the profile cannot prove the allowed argument set
- `add_key`, `keyctl`
- `userfaultfd`
- `chroot`
- `open_by_handle_at`, `name_to_handle_at`
- `process_vm_readv`, `process_vm_writev`, `kcmp`
- `clock_settime`, `clock_adjtime`, `settimeofday`, `stime`
- `iopl`, `ioperm`

Do not treat ordinary `clone`/`clone3` use for process or thread creation as a finding by itself. Most real workloads need process/thread creation. The review concern is namespace creation or namespace transition: `clone`/`clone3` with `CLONE_NEW*` flags, `setns`, `unshare`, or combinations with powerful capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. If the seccomp profile or review tooling cannot express or show argument filters, record that uncertainty and require manual review of the effective runtime profile instead of automatically classifying the workload as high-risk.

### 6.3 Canonical syscall policy

This table is the canonical policy for high-risk syscall review. The explanatory table below and the reviewer decision matrix in section 9 must stay aligned with it.

| Syscall / group | Default action | Exception level | Required capabilities/context to review | Evidence before approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bpf` | Fail | Exceptional security sign-off | eBPF/observability/CNI component; `CAP_BPF`, `CAP_PERFMON`, or legacy `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; kernel/runtime version | Component owner, exact program purpose, profile diff, runtime detection, expiry |
| `ptrace` | Fail | Exceptional security sign-off | Debug/profiling scope; PID namespace boundaries; `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`; production access path | Isolated debug design, audit logging, allowed subjects, expiry |
| `kexec_load`, `kexec_file_load` | Fail | Exceptional security sign-off | Node-level agent only; `CAP_SYS_BOOT`; host lifecycle control | Separate privileged security model, node scope, approval, expiry |
| `init_module`, `finit_module`, `delete_module` | Fail | Exceptional security sign-off | Node-level agent only; `CAP_SYS_MODULE`; kernel module lifecycle | Separate privileged security model, module allowlist, node scope, expiry |
| `io_uring_setup`, `io_uring_enter`, `io_uring_register` | Manual review | Strong justification | Performance need; blocked classic file/network syscalls; kernel/runtime behavior | Fallback plan, bypass analysis, load test, accepted residual risk |
| `perf_event_open` | Manual review | Strong justification | Profiling/tracing scope; `CAP_PERFMON` or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; `perf_event_paranoid` | Profiling owner, data exposure analysis, isolated execution path |
| `mount`, `umount`, `umount2`, `pivot_root` | Manual review | Strong justification | `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; mount namespace; writable paths; volume/CSI alternative | Why Kubernetes volumes/CSI are insufficient, mount target list, expiry |
| `unshare`, `setns`, `clone`, `clone3` with namespace flags or unknown argument filtering | Manual review | Strong justification | Namespace flags, user namespaces, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, target namespace | Effective profile with argument filters or explicit uncertainty record |
| `add_key`, `keyctl`, `request_key` | Manual review | Strong justification | Kernel keyring use; secret storage alternative; namespace behavior | Why Vault/KMS/tmpfs is insufficient, key lifecycle, monitoring |
| `userfaultfd` | Manual review | Strong justification | CRIU/migration/runtime need; kernel version; memory-management exposure | Runtime owner, kernel assumption, fallback, expiry |
| `chroot` | Manual review | Strong justification | `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`; mount layout; writable paths | Why runtime/volume model is insufficient, path and mount review |
| `open_by_handle_at`, `name_to_handle_at` | Manual review | Strong justification | Storage-agent scenario; mount fd access; filesystem controls | Storage owner, allowed mounts, path-control impact analysis |
| `process_vm_readv`, `process_vm_writev`, `kcmp` | Manual review | Strong justification | Debug/profiling scope; PID namespace; `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` adjacency | Isolated profiler design, target process scope, audit evidence |
| `clock_settime`, `clock_adjtime`, `settimeofday`, `stime` | Manual review | Strong justification | Time management component; `CAP_SYS_TIME`; host/global time impact | Time authority owner, NTP/control-plane impact analysis, expiry |
| `iopl`, `ioperm` | Manual review | Strong justification | Hardware/low-level I/O scenario; `CAP_SYS_RAWIO`; device exposure | Dedicated node model, device allowlist, isolation evidence |

### 6.4 Why risky syscalls exist and why they are restricted

Use this table during review to distinguish real technical need from "the application starts this way". If a syscall is allowed, the exception should state which component calls it, which operation is impossible without it, why a less privileged path is not viable, which capabilities are granted to the container, and how expanded use is detected.

| Syscall / group | Common use | What it gives the process | Why restrict it or require justification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bpf` | Creating and managing eBPF maps/programs, loading eBPF programs into the kernel, attaching to tracing/network/control-plane events. | Ability to run verified but still kernel-resident code and store state in kernel-managed structures. | This is direct interaction with kernel subsystems. Normal app workloads almost never need it; it often appears as observability/CNI/tracing noise. Allow only for explicitly scoped eBPF/observability components with separate security review and minimal capabilities (`CAP_BPF`, `CAP_PERFMON`, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` in older models). |
| `ptrace` | Debugging, tracing, inspecting, and modifying another process. | Reading/changing tracee registers and memory, intercepting syscalls and signals. | In a container, this risks secret disclosure and interference with neighboring processes in the same PID namespace; with a flawed namespace/capability model, risk can cross workload boundaries. It should normally be blocked for production app containers except tightly isolated debug/profiling cases. |
| `kexec_load`, `kexec_file_load` | Loading a new kernel image for later transition without a full firmware boot. | Preparing the system to reboot into another kernel. | A container workload should not have a path to control the kernel boot chain. Presence in a profile almost always indicates profiling error or excessive privileges; it is also tied to `CAP_SYS_BOOT`. |
| `init_module`, `finit_module`, `delete_module` | Loading and removing kernel modules. | Changing code that runs in kernel space. | This is a host-level operation and incompatible with the normal container isolation model. It is acceptable only for very specialized node-level agents, in which case the design is a separate privileged security model, not a regular workload profile. |
| `io_uring_setup`, `io_uring_enter`, `io_uring_register` | Creating rings and executing asynchronous I/O through io_uring. | A high-performance I/O interface where one syscall family can initiate different file/network-like operations. | This is a bypass risk for profiles that block "classic" file/network syscalls while leaving io_uring open. Allow only with proven performance need, documented fallback, and validation that the profile does not rely on restrictions bypassed through io_uring. |
| `perf_event_open` | Performance counters, profiling, tracing, CPU/kernel/user-space events. | Access to counters and sample/ring-buffer data; some modes require `CAP_PERFMON` or `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or depend on `perf_event_paranoid`. | It can expose process and host/kernel activity and interacts with BPF/perf infrastructure. App containers usually do not need it; move profiling into controlled jobs or node agents. |
| `mount`, `umount`, `umount2`, `pivot_root` | Mounting, unmounting, and changing the root filesystem. | Changing the mount namespace and filesystem visibility. | With `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, this is one of the broadest container escape and host filesystem exposure surfaces. Regular workloads should not mount at runtime; use Kubernetes volumes/CSI/init-time preparation instead of allowing the syscall. |
| `clone`, `clone3`, `unshare`, `setns` | Creating processes/threads and namespaces, entering existing namespaces. | Control over process namespace/topology, including user/mount/network/PID namespace scenarios. | Not every `clone` is dangerous: most applications need processes and threads. Risk appears with namespace flags, `setns`, and `unshare`, especially alongside capabilities and user namespaces. In custom profiles, check arguments, not only the syscall name. |
| `add_key`, `keyctl`, `request_key` | Using the kernel keyring. | Creating, finding, and using keys in kernel-managed keyrings. | The keyring has historically not been a simple per-container resource and can create unwanted cross-boundary effects. Applications should use standard secret stores, tmpfs volumes, or KMS integrations instead of the kernel keyring. |
| `userfaultfd` | User-space page-fault handling, live migration, checkpoint/restore, memory-management runtimes. | Delegating page-fault handling to user space for selected memory regions. | Useful for specialized runtime/CRIU/migration cases, but rarely needed by a normal service. It expands the kernel memory-management attack surface; require an owner, kernel-version assumptions, and confirmation that a simpler mechanism cannot replace it. |
| `chroot` | Changing the process root directory. | Restricting path resolution relative to a new root. | `chroot` is not container isolation by itself and can create false sandboxing assumptions. In Kubernetes, the root filesystem should be controlled by the runtime/volume model; runtime `chroot` inside an app container requires explanation and review of `CAP_SYS_CHROOT`, mounts, and writable paths. |
| `open_by_handle_at`, `name_to_handle_at` | Opening a file by persistent file handle and obtaining such a handle. | Bypassing ordinary path-based name resolution when the process has a suitable mount fd and rights. | This can break assumptions behind path-based controls and has appeared in historical container breakout classes. Block in app profiles unless there is a very specific storage-agent scenario. |
| `process_vm_readv`, `process_vm_writev`, `kcmp` | Cross-process memory read/write and comparison of kernel resources used by processes. | Inspecting or modifying another process without a ptrace-style workflow. | This is process-inspection surface close to debug/tracing risk. Block for normal app containers; for profilers, require a separate scope, PID namespace boundaries, and capability restrictions. |
| Time syscalls: `clock_settime`, `clock_adjtime`, `settimeofday`, `stime` | Changing system time. | Influence over host/global timekeeping where time is not namespaced. | Can break TLS, audit, scheduling, and distributed-systems assumptions. Containers normally should not change time; this is tied to `CAP_SYS_TIME`. |
| Low-level I/O syscalls: `iopl`, `ioperm` | Managing I/O privilege level and access to I/O ports. | Low-level access to hardware/architecture interfaces. | Normal workloads do not need it and it carries host-level risk; it should generally stay outside containers together with `CAP_SYS_RAWIO`. |

### 6.5 Mandatory `io_uring` checks

Treat `io_uring` as a syscall-multiplexing risk. Check the anti-pattern:
- classic network/file syscalls blocked;
- `io_uring_setup` + `io_uring_enter` allowed.

Always document:
- business need for `io_uring`;
- fallback without `io_uring`;
- accepted residual risk.

### 6.6 Mandatory `bpf` checks

If `bpf` is allowed, treat the profile as presumptively unsafe until proven otherwise.
Check whether `bpf` was included accidentally via tracing/runtime/CNI/capability noise.

### 6.7 Mandatory bypass combo checks

Check combinations:
- `io_uring_setup` + `io_uring_enter` while network syscalls are blocked;
- `io_uring_setup` + `io_uring_enter` while file/filesystem-path syscalls are blocked;
- `io_uring_setup` + `io_uring_enter` while `splice`/`tee`/`vmsplice` are blocked;
- `io_uring_setup` + `io_uring_enter` with futex/process-wait restrictions;
- `io_uring_setup` + `io_uring_enter` while `ioctl` or xattr syscalls are blocked.

## 7. Runtime, Capabilities, Architecture

### 7.1 Do not review seccomp separately from capabilities

Assess effective policy together with capabilities, especially `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_BPF`, and other kernel-facing capabilities.

### 7.2 Account for runtime implementation of effective profile

Confirm:
- profile is static or runtime-generated;
- capability-sensitive mutations happen at startup.

### 7.3 Architecture and ABI coverage

Verify explicit coverage for target architectures. In relevant environments, check x32 ABI blind spots (`SCMP_ARCH_X32`).

---

## 8. Operational Correctness and Lifecycle

### 8.1 Functional correctness

A profile must not break production, but adding high-risk syscalls just to make startup succeed is not acceptable.

### 8.2 Realistic validation

Profiling/validation should include:
- real startup path;
- real dependency initialization;
- sidecar/init behavior when present;
- production-like kernel/runtime;
- relevant architectures and libc.

### 8.3 CI/CD policy gates

Minimum controls:
- fail build on forbidden syscalls;
- fail build on dangerous combo patterns;
- require manual security review for high-risk deltas;
- enforce exception tracking (owner + expiry).

### 8.4 Drift and effective-profile verification on nodes

Do not rely only on Git YAML. Store approved profile hash and compare it with runtime effective profile via runtime inspection (`crictl inspect` / runtime API) at least every `24h` and after kernel/runtime/capability changes.

---

## 9. Reviewer Decision Matrix

### 9.1 Canonical anti-patterns (single list)

- Auto-generated profile approved without manual curation.
- Quality judged by "number of blocked syscalls".
- Classic syscalls blocked while `io_uring` remains open.
- Static YAML/JSON reviewed without runtime context.
- App syscalls mixed with runtime/init/CNI noise.
- Dangerous syscalls kept because "the workload runs with them".
- Powerful capabilities granted without seccomp re-review.

### 9.2 Fail immediately if

- any section 6.3 syscall with default action `Fail` is allowed without exceptional justification and security sign-off;
- `io_uring` is allowed but bypass implications were not reviewed;
- effective runtime policy is unknown;
- capabilities and seccomp were reviewed independently.

### 9.3 Escalate to manual security review if

- any section 6.3 syscall with default action `Manual review` is present;
- `clone/clone3` is allowed with namespace-creating flags, appears together with `setns`/`unshare` or powerful capabilities, or cannot be reviewed at argument level;
- profile is Pod-wide for a multi-container Pod;
- runtime mutates effective policy dynamically;
- workload needs stronger isolation than seccomp can realistically provide.

### 9.4 Accept with conditions if

- high-risk syscalls are removed or tightly justified;
- scope is correct;
- architecture/ABI coverage is verified;
- bypass combinations and residual risk are documented;
- CI/CD enforces continuous validation.

---

## 10. Final Review Statement

A good seccomp profile:
- reduces real attack surface;
- excludes or tightly controls high-risk syscalls;
- accounts for bypass combinations, runtime, and capabilities;
- is maintained as a continuous process, not a one-time setup.

A profile that is merely "strict" or present in YAML is not sufficient by itself.
