# Security Playbook for OIDC + OAuth 2.0

## 1. Scope and Objective

This playbook describes secure OIDC (authentication) and OAuth 2.0 (authorization) integration with Keycloak.

---

## 2. OIDC + OAuth 2.0 Workflow and Token Purpose

- **OIDC** handles user login and identity context via `id_token`
- **OAuth 2.0** handles delegated API access via `access_token`/`refresh_token`
- In Authorization Code flow, both are used together in one end-to-end sequence

### 2.1 Sequence (Authorization Code + PKCE, SPA + BFF pattern)

    participant U as User Browser (SPA)
    participant B as BFF
    participant I as IdP (Keycloak)
    participant A as Resource API

    U->>B: GET /login
    B->>U: Redirect to IdP /authorize (state, nonce, code_challenge)
    U->>I: Authorization request
    I->>U: Login + consent
    I->>B: Redirect callback with code + state
    B->>B: Validate state + nonce context
    B->>I: POST /token (code + code_verifier)
    I-->>B: id_token + access_token + refresh_token
    B->>B: Validate id_token (iss, aud, exp, nonce, sig)
    B->>U: Set HttpOnly session cookie
    U->>B: API request via session
    B->>A: Forward access_token (aud/scopes constrained)
    A-->>B: API response
    B-->>U: Application response
```

### 2.2 Token sets by flow

1. `authorization_code` (with OIDC scope):
- `id_token` + `access_token` + often `refresh_token`

2. `authorization_code` (without OIDC scope):
- `access_token` + often `refresh_token`, no `id_token`

3. `client_credentials`:
- only `access_token` (usually no refresh token)

4. `token exchange` (RFC 8693, Keycloak V2):
- input token -> new `access_token` (different audience/scope)

5. `offline_access` (scope, not flow):
- `offline_access` is an OAuth scope that changes refresh token semantics
- when requested and granted, an offline token is issued with long-lived or non-session-bound behavior
- this is not a separate grant flow, but token behavior modification in existing flows (for example, authorization_code)

### 2.3 Purpose of each token

- `id_token`: user authentication result for client session context
- `access_token`: bearer presented to resource server for authorization
- `refresh_token`: gets new access tokens without full re-login
- `offline token`: gets new tokens without active browser session
- `userinfo` response: optional source of additional profile claims, not a replacement for `id_token` validation

Identity rule:
- Use `sub` as primary stable user identifier in application
- Do not use `email` as primary identity key

### 2.4 Critical security rules

- Never use `id_token` as API bearer
- Keep `aud` and `scope` narrow
- Use explicit numeric token/session limits (see section 5), not vague "short/long" wording
- PKCE is mandatory for public clients

What PKCE is and why it is needed:
- PKCE (`Proof Key for Code Exchange`) adds a `code_challenge`/`code_verifier` pair to Authorization Code flow.
- It protects against authorization code interception: even if the code is stolen in redirect/callback paths, it cannot be exchanged for tokens without the `code_verifier`.

---

## 3. Recommended Architecture Patterns

### 3.1 Web Backend (server-rendered)

- Confidential client
- Authorization Code flow
- PKCE enabled (recommended even for confidential clients)
- Tokens are stored on backend
- Browser receives only session cookie

### 3.2 SPA + BFF (recommended for browser)

- SPA (`Single-Page Application`) is the browser-side frontend (JavaScript app) running in the user browser.
- BFF (`Backend for Frontend`) is a dedicated server-side backend for that frontend.
- SPA does not store refresh token
- BFF performs code exchange and stores refresh token server-side
- SPA talks to BFF through protected cookie-based session
- BFF calls APIs on behalf of user

### 3.3 Mobile

- Public client
- Authorization Code + PKCE (`S256`)
- System browser only (ASWebAuthenticationSession / Custom Tabs)
- Refresh token stored only in OS secure storage

### 3.4 Service-to-service

- OAuth Client Credentials
- Separate machine clients and scopes/roles
- Do not mix user tokens and service tokens

---

## 4. Protection Profile Matrix (Recommended vs Maximum)

Maximum profile is defined as a **delta** to Recommended: the Maximum column lists only additional or stricter requirements.
Reading rule for controls below:
- If a bullet has no tag, it applies to both profiles (`R+M`)
- Maximum-only hardening is grouped under dedicated "Maximum profile hardening" blocks

| Control | Recommended (R) | Maximum (M) | Rationale / Threat |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flow and base client model | Authorization Code + PKCE (`S256`), SPA+BFF/server-side web app, mobile public + system browser, service confidential + client_credentials | In addition to R: mandatory strict client policies at IdP level | Reduces code interception risk, token misuse, and misconfiguration drift |
| Sender-constrained tokens | Bearer tokens are acceptable only after an explicit risk decision; public, partner, and high-value APIs must evaluate DPoP or mTLS and document any exception | In addition to R: require DPoP and/or mTLS, minimum refresh-token binding for public clients | Reduces impact of bearer token theft and replay |
| PAR/JAR | Not mandatory by default | In addition to R: PAR (RFC 9126) + JAR (RFC 9101) for critical clients | Protects authorization parameters from tampering/mix-up, reduces front-channel risks |
| MFA/step-up | Risk-based according to business policy | In addition to R: mandatory MFA/step-up for critical operations | Protects against account takeover and unauthorized privilege escalation |
| Token TTL/rotation | Short TTLs, refresh token rotation, explicit numeric limits from section 5 | In addition to R: stricter TTLs and degraded windows for high-risk environments | Reduces exploitation window for compromised tokens |
| Token validation | `iss/aud/exp/nbf/iat/signature`, `alg` allowlist, `nonce`, `azp`, policy checks | In addition to R: mandatory holder-of-key validation for sender-constrained tokens | Protects against forged/misissued tokens, mix-up, and key confusion |
| Session/Cookies | HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite, narrow Domain/Path, session ID rotation, CSRF controls | In addition to R: no cross-origin on session-bound endpoints without approved exception | Protects against XSS cookie theft, CSRF, fixation, cookie scope abuse |
| Logout/Revocation | RP-initiated logout + local logout + refresh revocation | In addition to R: mandatory introspection for sensitive APIs in post-logout/post-incident windows | Reduces replay after logout and accelerates revocation effect |
| Key management | Planned signing key rotation, trusted JWKS/issuer pinning | In addition to R: faster cadence and stricter emergency cutover SLA | Reduces blast radius in key compromise events |
| Operations/Monitoring | Baseline rate limits, lockout signals, auth/token anomaly monitoring | In addition to R: stronger anti-automation controls, stricter alerting and SLOs | Reduces brute-force/abuse and improves incident MTTR |

## 5. Unified Numeric Baseline (single source of truth)

All numeric limits for token/session/replay/rate-limiting are defined here. Other sections should reference this baseline instead of duplicating values.

These numbers are a local recommended production baseline, not direct RFC or OIDC Core requirements. Treat them as default guardrails for this playbook and tune them by risk profile, user experience, client capability, and IdP behavior.

### 5.1 Token and session timing

- Access token TTL: `5-15m` (default: `10m`)
- ID token TTL: `<=5m`
- Browser/BFF refresh token absolute max lifetime: `<=24h`
- Mobile refresh token absolute max lifetime: `<=30d` only with secure enclave/keystore storage and device trust controls
- Refresh token reuse grace window (retry races): `<=30s`
- User session idle timeout (browser): `15m`
- User session max age (browser): `8h`
- Fresh auth (`max_age`) for high-risk operations: `<=15m`
- JWT/client clock skew tolerance: `<=60s` (hard limit: `<=120s`)

### 5.2 Replay and rate-limiting baseline

- Token endpoint rate limit (per client + source IP): `60 req/min` sustained
- Burst budget: `120 req/min` within `<=1m`
- Brute-force lockout signal: `10` failed attempts in `5m`
- Callback state/nonce TTL: `<=10m`, single-use
- Introspection timeout budget: connect `<=100ms`, response `<=300ms`, total `<=500ms`
- Introspection cache TTL: positive `<=30s` (never above token `exp`/`Not Before`), negative `<=5s`
- Allowed degraded `fail-open` window only for low-risk class C and only by exception: `<=120s`

### 5.3 Maximum profile hardening

- For high-risk/regulated environments: tighten TTLs and max degraded windows relative to baseline values
- For high-risk/regulated environments: use stricter rate-limiting/burst/cache/degraded windows

---

## 6. Control Domains

### 6.1 Identity Flow

- Use Authorization Code + PKCE (`S256`) for browser/mobile user login
- Enforce strict callback integrity checks: `state` is mandatory and must match request->callback exactly
- `nonce` is mandatory for OIDC login and must match original authorization request value
- Redirect/logout URIs: exact match only and separate lists per environment
- Block the `implicit` grant by default; any temporary exception requires a migration plan, owner, expiry, and compensating controls.
- The OAuth password grant / Resource Owner Password Credentials flow is forbidden for production clients. Do not approve it as a normal exception path; use only a time-boxed migration plan for existing legacy clients.
- Replacement paths: Authorization Code + PKCE for browser/mobile/user login, device authorization flow where user interaction happens on a constrained device, and `client_credentials` for service-to-service access.

Maximum profile hardening:
- Enable PAR/JAR for critical clients and elevated-risk flows

### 6.2 Token Security

- Validate `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, signature (`kid`/JWKS)
- Enforce JWT `alg` allowlist and reject unexpected algorithms
- Validate `azp` when present (especially with multiple audiences)
- Validate authorization scopes + roles + policy (deny-by-default)
- Never use `id_token` as API bearer
- Use short TTL/rotation and explicit audience (see section 5)
- Keep `Revoke Refresh Token` enabled (rotation)
- Introspection is mandatory for high-risk operations, suspicious tokens, and post-incident windows
- Bearer access tokens are acceptable only after a documented risk decision. For public, partner, high-value, or high-replay-impact APIs, evaluate sender-constrained tokens (`DPoP` and/or `mTLS`). If bearer-only is approved, document client support constraints, XSS/client-compromise caveats, compensating controls, and token TTL.

Maximum profile hardening:
- Require sender-constrained tokens (DPoP and/or mTLS)
- For public clients: minimum bind refresh token, preferably refresh + access
- Verify holder-of-key validation support in adapters/runtime for DPoP/mTLS

### 6.3 Session and Cookies

- Browser stores session cookie only; refresh/offline tokens in browser storage are forbidden
- Application server stores session state (Redis/DB/in-memory with replication)
- Rotate session ID after login callback and after privilege elevation
- Cookie `HttpOnly`: blocks JS access and reduces XSS-driven cookie theft
- Cookie `Secure`: sends cookie over HTTPS only, reducing in-transit interception risk
- Cookie `SameSite=Lax` (or `None; Secure` for cross-site SSO): reduces CSRF/login CSRF risk
- Narrow `Domain`/`Path`: reduces cross-app leakage and cookie tossing/subdomain takeover impact
- CSRF protection is mandatory for state-changing BFF endpoints (`POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`): use a synchronizer token or a signed double-submit cookie bound to the authenticated session with HMAC and a server-side secret; naive double-submit cookies are not acceptable
- Validate `Origin` (primary) and `Referer` (fallback) for browser state-changing requests
- Apply same-origin policy for session-bound endpoints and enforce `Sec-Fetch-Site` checks
- Negative tests must include cookie injection/subdomain cookie scenarios, missing token, mismatched token, cross-site `Origin`, and absent `Sec-Fetch-*` fallback behavior

Maximum profile hardening:
- For session-bound endpoints, do not allow cross-origin CORS without explicitly approved exception

### 6.4 Logout and Revocation

- Implement secure logout flow: local session destroy -> RP-initiated logout -> strict `post_logout_redirect_uri`
- Revoke refresh token on logout via `/protocol/openid-connect/revoke` (RFC 7009)
- For multi-RP ecosystems, configure back-channel/front-channel logout with fallback behavior
- For global incidents, use `Sign out all active sessions` + realm/client `Not Before`
- Treat sign-out alone as insufficient for already issued access tokens until `exp` (see section 5)
- For sensitive APIs, introspection is mandatory in `<=15m` window after logout/revocation/Not Before update
- Reject tokens that are inactive, issued before `Not Before`, or violate binding context

Maximum profile hardening:
- Expand mandatory introspection scope to additional endpoint classes

### 6.5 Key Management

- Validate JWT signatures only against trusted JWKS (`/protocol/openid-connect/certs`) from expected issuer
- `kid` must resolve to active JWKS key; untrusted/user-controlled JWKS URLs are forbidden
- Planned realm signing key rotation is mandatory
- Rotation model: introduce new key in advance (active/passive), retire old key only after compatibility window
- Emergency compromise response: immediate new key issuance and session/token invalidation
- Baseline cadence: signing key rotation every `90d`, overlap `24-72h`, emergency cutover `<=1h`
- HTTPS only; mTLS for trusted internal channels where required by threat model
- For confidential clients prefer `private_key_jwt` or mTLS; allow `client_secret` only with mandatory rotation

Maximum profile hardening:
- Tighten rotation cadence and emergency SLA for regulated/high-risk environments

### 6.6 Operations and Monitoring

- Centralize JWT/introspection validation in middleware and preserve deny-by-default authorization
- Enable IdP admin/user event auditing and SIEM correlation between auth and API events
- Monitor token endpoint errors, refresh failures, invalid signature, invalid audience, token-exchange/DPoP failures
- Capture and alert on replay signals (`state`/`nonce` reuse, repeated callback correlation IDs)
- For introspection, use circuit breaker + backoff + automatic policy normalization after confirmed recovery
- Define per-endpoint-class behavior:
  - Class A (money movement/admin/privilege changes/PII export): `fail-closed`
  - Class B (state-changing business operations): `fail-closed`
  - Class C (low-risk read-only): explicit decision; `fail-open` only by approved exception

Maximum profile hardening:
- Strengthen anti-automation controls and alerts (lower thresholds, faster response SLA)

## 7. Threat-Driven Checks (Mandatory in Review)

- Authorization code interception -> PKCE + exact redirect URI
- Bearer token theft -> short TTL + sender-constrained tokens where risk profile requires
- Refresh token reuse -> rotation + reuse detection
- Open redirect -> strict allowlist
- Mix-up attacks -> `iss` validation + strict client/issuer config
- Privilege escalation -> strict audience/scope/role separation
- Session fixation -> session ID rotation after login
- Token leakage in logs -> redaction and explicit no-token logging policy

---

## 8. Anti-patterns

- Using `id_token` as API bearer
- PKCE `plain` instead of `S256`
- Wildcard redirect URI
- Storing refresh token in browser storage
- Enabling password grant / Keycloak Direct Access Grants for production clients
- Long access token TTL (hours/days)
- Single client for user login and machine-to-machine traffic without segregation
- Missing key rotation and missing key-compromise response procedure

---

## 9. Step-by-Step Integration with Keycloak

### Step 1. Realm and cryptography baseline

- Configure realm keys and rotation plan (see Key Management domain)
- Enable admin/user event audit
- Verify HTTPS and correct proxy header handling

### Step 2. Create client types

- `web-bff` (confidential)
- `spa-frontend` (if separate public client is needed)
- `mobile-app` (public + PKCE)
- `service-api-client` (confidential + `client_credentials`)

### Step 3. Lock redirect/logout URIs

- Exact match only
- Separate URI sets per environment
- Configure `Valid Post Logout Redirect URIs`

### Step 4. Enable secure capabilities

- Standard Flow: ON
- Implicit: OFF
- Direct Access Grants: OFF. In Keycloak this corresponds to the password grant and must remain disabled for production clients; legacy use requires a migration plan, not a standing exception.
- PKCE method: `S256`
- Revoke Refresh Token: ON (typically)

Maximum profile hardening:
- Enable PAR/JAR and sender-constrained tokens for selected high-risk clients

### Step 5. Configure scopes/roles/audience

- Minimal client scopes
- Separate API client roles
- Audience mapping to exact resource servers

### Step 6. Integrate application

- Use `.well-known/openid-configuration` as endpoint source
- Pin trust to expected `issuer` and use only that issuer's `jwks_uri`
- Keep browser session cookie, not bearer tokens in browser storage
- In callback, strictly validate `state` and `nonce` before creating local session

### Step 7. Build resource server middleware

- Centralize JWT/introspection validation
- Enforce `iss/aud/exp/nbf` and scope/role checks
- Preserve deny-by-default authorization

### Step 8. Implement logout/revocation/invalidation

- Implement RP-initiated logout
- Implement refresh-token revocation path
- Prepare incident runbook for mass `Not Before`

### Step 9. Monitoring and detection

- Implement the metrics and alerts set from Operations/Monitoring domain
- Maintain response runbook for replay/brute-force/token-abuse signals
