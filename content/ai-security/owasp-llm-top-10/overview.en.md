# OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)

## 1. Scope

This overview is a threat-focused summary of OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025).

This overview focuses on:
- how each threat emerges in real systems
- what technical and business risks it creates
- what adjacent risks can amplify impact

Document ownership:
- This document owns the threat taxonomy and risk vocabulary for LLM application reviews.
- It explains prompt injection, data leakage, tool abuse, excessive agency, and related risks as categories and attack mechanics.
- It does not define the production control baseline; use [Securing AI](../securing-ai/overview.en.md) for controls, implementation priorities, and verification signals.
- It does not replace the specialized playbooks for agent autonomy or MCP protocol governance.

---

## 2. Threat context (how LLM incidents happen in reality)

Most incidents are failures at trust boundaries between components:
- user input -> model
- external content -> RAG/indexing -> model
- model output -> tools/API/DB
- model runtime -> cost/quotas/infrastructure
- model lifecycle -> datasets/adapters/registries/deployment

In real reviews, these areas are non-negotiable:
- IAM and authorization for tools and downstream systems
- data classification and handling (PII, secrets, etc.)
- secure output processing before execution/rendering
- provenance and integrity of models/adapters/datasets

## 3. Threat-focused breakdown of OWASP LLM Top 10

This document intentionally focuses on threats, attack mechanics, and risks.
For practical controls, implementation priorities, and verification signals, see [Securing AI](../securing-ai/overview.en.md). For agent autonomy, memory, tool execution, and action traces, use the [Agentic AI security playbook](../agentic-ai/playbook.en.md). For MCP server registry, protocol deployment, OAuth usage, and capability drift, use the [MCP security playbook](../mcp-security/playbook.en.md).

## 3.1 LLM01: Prompt Injection

### Summary (OWASP)
A vulnerability where input (including hidden or external content) changes LLM behavior against expected rules and can lead to unauthorized actions.

### How it appears in live environments
- hidden instructions in documents, web pages, emails, images
- prompts like "ignore previous instructions"
- obfuscation (encodings, multilingual payloads, split payload)

### Main risks
- unauthorized tool invocation
- exfiltration of sensitive data
- manipulation of decisions in business processes

---

## 3.2 LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure

### Summary (OWASP)
Risk of exposing sensitive information (PII, secrets, internal data, intellectual property) via LLM responses, context, training, or insecure data handling.

### How it appears in live environments
- leakage of PII/secrets from chat history in responses
- confidential data entering training/fine-tuning
- disclosure of internal configs and diagnostic details

### Main risks
- privacy breach and regulatory penalties
- credential compromise and lateral movement
- intellectual property and trade secret leakage

---

## 3.3 LLM03: Supply Chain

### Summary (OWASP)
LLM supply chain risks: untrusted models, adapters, data, dependencies, and infrastructure that can be tampered with, vulnerable, or legally problematic.

### How it appears in live environments
- vulnerable dependencies in the ML/LLM pipeline
- untrusted base model, LoRA adapter, artifact converter
- compromised model repository accounts or fake models

### Main risks
- backdoor model behavior
- malicious code execution in training/inference environments
- legal and compliance risks related to licenses/T&C

---

## 3.4 LLM04: Data and Model Poisoning

### Summary (OWASP)
Data and model poisoning attacks where triggers and biases are introduced into training/fine-tuning/RAG, compromising model behavior integrity and safety.

### How it appears in live environments
- poisoned training/fine-tuning datasets
- trigger/backdoor behavior activated by specific phrases
- malicious embeddings/documents in the RAG corpus

### Main risks
- integrity loss (bias, manipulation, toxic output)
- hidden trigger-based backdoor behavior
- fraud and unsafe automation in downstream processes

---

## 3.5 LLM05: Improper Output Handling

### Summary (OWASP)
Insufficient validation and sanitization of LLM output before passing it to consumer systems (for example: SQL/API/shell/template renderer/browser), making model responses an injection vector and enabling malicious code execution.

Here, downstream systems means any component that consumes LLM output and performs an action: databases, APIs, shell runners, template engines, browser renderers, workers, and automation pipelines.

### How it appears in live environments
- model output sent directly to shell/API/SQL/template renderer
- LLM-generated JS/Markdown rendered without sanitization
- generated code/packages used without verification

### Main risks
- XSS, SQLi, SSRF, RCE via downstream execution
- escalation through tool invocation chains
- supply-chain compromise via hallucinated packages

---

## 3.6 LLM06: Excessive Agency

### Summary (OWASP)
Excessive autonomy of an LLM agent (tools/plugins/functions and permissions), allowing dangerous actions from ambiguous, incorrect, or manipulated instructions.

### How it appears in live environments
- the agent has extra tools not needed for the task
- plugins operate with permissions broader than the user scope
- destructive actions execute autonomously and without confirmation

### Main risks
- unauthorized changes/deletions/transactions
- cross-tenant leakage due to over-privileged identity
- rapidly growing blast radius in agentic architectures

---

## 3.7 LLM07: System Prompt Leakage

### Summary (OWASP)
Leakage of system prompts and hidden instructions, which should not be treated as secrets but, if disclosed, make it easier to bypass defenses and develop chained attacks.

### How it appears in live environments
- system prompt extraction via probing
- disclosure of internal logic, roles, constraints
- incorrect storage of secrets in prompt/config text

### Main risks
- accelerated guardrail bypass
- compromise of architectural details and secrets
- chained attacks: leakage + injection + privilege abuse

---

## 3.8 LLM08: Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

### Summary (OWASP)
Weaknesses in generating, storing, and retrieving embeddings/vectors (especially in RAG), leading to cross-tenant leakage, poisoned context, and unauthorized access.

### How it appears in live environments
- cross-tenant leakage in a shared vector DB
- poisoned documents in the retrieval corpus
- embedding inversion and data reconstruction risks

### Main risks
- confidential data leakage via retrieval
- response manipulation through poisoned context
- legal and compliance risks due to data sources

---

## 3.9 LLM09: Misinformation

### Summary (OWASP)
Generation of plausible but false or misleading information (due to hallucination, bias, or incomplete context), creating operational and legal risks.

### How it appears in live environments
- confident but false answers in legal/medical/finance domains
- fabricated references, invalid claims, non-existent packages
- excessive user trust in model output

### Main risks
- dangerous business decisions and user harm
- reputational and legal damage
- security risks from incorrect technical recommendations

---

## 3.10 LLM10: Unbounded Consumption

### Summary (OWASP)
Uncontrolled consumption of LLM resources (requests, tokens, inference), leading to DoS, denial-of-wallet, service degradation, and model extraction risks.

### How it appears in live environments
- prompt flooding, abuse of large context, long sessions
- denial-of-wallet attacks on usage-based billing
- model extraction attempts via API probing

### Main risks
- service degradation and DoS
- uncontrolled cost growth
- model theft and IP loss

---

## 4. Threat Differentiation Summary

- `LLM01 Prompt Injection`: attacks execution instructions; key distinction is behavioral control of the model through input content.
- `LLM02 Sensitive Information Disclosure`: leaks sensitive data in outputs; distinction is confidentiality impact rather than action control.
- `LLM03 Supply Chain`: compromises external dependencies in the LLM stack; distinction is risk entering through vendors/integrations.
- `LLM04 Data and Model Poisoning`: poisons training/indexed data; distinction is behavior manipulation by altering the model knowledge base.
- `LLM05 Improper Output Handling`: unsafely executes model output in consumer systems; distinction is the integration layer after generation.
- `LLM06 Excessive Agency`: grants an agent excessive permissions/tools; distinction is over-privileged autonomous action.
- `LLM07 System Prompt Leakage`: exposes hidden instructions and internal logic; distinction is easier guardrail bypass, not direct code execution by itself.
- `LLM08 Vector and Embedding Weaknesses`: weaknesses in retrieval/embeddings/RAG storage; distinction is the context and retrieval layer.
- `LLM09 Misinformation`: produces plausible but false content; distinction is decision-quality and trust risk rather than direct exploitation.
- `LLM10 Unbounded Consumption`: allows uncontrolled token/resource usage; distinction is availability and cost impact (DoS/denial-of-wallet).
