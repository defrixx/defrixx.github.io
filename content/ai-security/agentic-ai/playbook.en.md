# Agentic AI Security Playbook

## 1. Scope and Objective

This playbook covers AI agents and multi-agent workflows that plan, call tools, use memory, retrieve context, execute code, browse the web, or change business state.

Use this document for:
- security review of autonomous and semi-autonomous workflows;
- release gates for agents with tools, memory, browser/email/file access, or code execution;
- defining policy enforcement, action tracing, approval, rollback, and kill-switch requirements;
- building negative tests for tool misuse, memory poisoning, delegation abuse, and runaway loops.

Document ownership:
- This playbook owns agent autonomy, tool use by agents, memory/scratchpad/checkpoint handling, action traces, approvals, rollback, and kill-switch behavior.
- It treats prompt injection, data leakage, and excessive agency through the lens of agent execution and business impact.
- It relies on [Securing AI](../securing-ai/overview.en.md) for the general AI control baseline and on the [OWASP LLM Top 10 overview](../owasp-llm-top-10/overview.en.md) for threat taxonomy.
- It does not define MCP protocol, server registry, or transport governance controls; use the [MCP security playbook](../mcp-security/playbook.en.md).

Out of scope:
- MCP protocol-specific controls; use the [MCP security playbook](../mcp-security/playbook.en.md);
- general LLM threat taxonomy; use the [OWASP LLM Top 10 overview](../owasp-llm-top-10/overview.en.md);
- generic API, browser, Kubernetes, and supply-chain controls unless they are part of the agent runtime.

Objective:
- ensure agents cannot turn ambiguous, malicious, or mistaken instructions into unauthorized access, unsafe execution, data leakage, or uncontrolled business impact.

## 2. Agent Threat Model

Minimum components to model:
- model and prompt layer;
- orchestration loop, planner, router, policy engine, and tool selector;
- working memory, scratchpad, long-term memory, retrieval stores, and checkpoints;
- tools and downstream systems;
- user, workload, and tool identities;
- browser, URL fetcher, file parser, code interpreter, shell, or office/email integration;
- audit trail, approvals, rollback paths, and kill switch.

High-impact scenarios:
- prompt injection or poisoned retrieval content causes the agent to call a tool outside the intended task;
- a long-running workflow accumulates secrets, PII, or tokens in scratchpad, memory, logs, or serialized checkpoints;
- a browser or code-execution tool downloads malicious content, executes generated code, or reaches internal network destinations;
- one agent delegates a task to a more privileged agent or shared tool without preserving the original authorization context;
- the agent performs technically valid actions that violate business intent, for example bulk deletion, duplicate transaction, or external disclosure.

## 3. Production Baseline

### 3.1 Agent Inventory and Classification

`Baseline`:
- Maintain an inventory of production agents, owners, runtime location, model/provider, autonomy level, tools, memory stores, retrieval sources, identities, data classes, and business operations.
- Classify each agent by maximum impact, not by intended use. A read-only assistant with access to confidential data is still sensitive; an agent with a single write tool may be high-impact.
- Assign an explicit autonomy profile:
  - `Assistive`: no tool execution or only user-visible draft output.
  - `Read-only tool user`: can retrieve data but cannot change business state.
  - `State-changing agent`: can create, update, submit, trigger, or delete.
  - `Execution agent`: can run code, browse, manipulate files, or interact with external content.

`High-impact/regulated`:
- Require a named product owner, security owner, SRE/operations owner, and data owner before launch.
- Review access and tool entitlements at least quarterly and after every material model/provider/tool change.

### 3.2 Policy Enforcement and Authorization

`Baseline`:
- Put a policy enforcement layer between model output and tool execution. The model may propose an action; policy decides whether it can run.
- Authorize every tool call using user/workload identity, tenant, role, data class, environment, action, and workflow state.
- Never treat model reasoning, natural-language instructions, prompt text, or tool descriptions as authorization evidence.
- Split tools by risk: separate read/write/admin/bulk/export/destructive operations into distinct capabilities with distinct scopes.
- Use short-lived, tool-specific credentials. Do not share one broad agent identity across unrelated tools.

`High-impact/regulated`:
- Require step-up authentication or human approval for high-impact, irreversible, cross-tenant, financial, security, privacy, or external-disclosure actions.
- Strip active tokens, secrets, and session cookies from checkpoints, scratchpads, persisted memory, tool outputs, and execution traces before storage.
- For multi-agent workflows, propagate original user/workload context and enforce delegation boundaries at every hop.

Starting defaults:
- `max autonomous steps=5` for read-only workflows;
- `max autonomous steps=3` before re-authorization for state-changing workflows;
- `max tool-chain depth=3`;
- default state-changing execution flow: `preview -> explicit confirm -> execute`;
- kill-switch SLO `<=60s` for state-changing or execution agents.

### 3.3 Memory, Retrieval, and State

`Baseline`:
- Treat working memory, scratchpads, long-term memory, vector stores, summaries, checkpoints, and tool outputs as data stores subject to classification, access control, retention, deletion, and audit requirements.
- Exclude secrets, tokens, credentials, raw regulated data, and unnecessary sensitive fields from memory by policy.
- Apply document-level and tenant-level authorization before retrieved content enters the agent context.
- Mark untrusted retrieved content as untrusted. It may inform the answer, but it must not override policy, identity, or tool authorization.
- Version prompts, memory rules, retrieval policies, embedding models, and dataset snapshots so incident response can roll back context, not only code.

`High-impact/regulated`:
- Use memory write policies that validate what the agent may persist, who can read it later, and when it expires.
- Quarantine or disable memory sources that show poisoning, unexpected sensitive data, or abnormal write patterns.
- Test recovery for semantic integrity: restored vector stores and memory must produce expected authorized retrieval behavior and must not reintroduce poisoned content.

Production defaults:
- no indefinite retention for working memory;
- raw session/scratchpad retention disabled by default outside forensic mode;
- memory entries containing sensitive data require explicit retention class and deletion workflow;
- forensic raw payload capture retention `<=30 days`.

### 3.4 Browser, Email, File, and Code Execution Tools

`Baseline`:
- Run browser automation, URL fetchers, file parsers, and code interpreters in isolated sandboxes with no default access to internal networks, host files, cloud metadata services, or production credentials.
- Enforce egress allowlists for agent-run browsers and fetch tools. Use deny-by-default for arbitrary public web access.
- Scan and sanitize downloaded or retrieved content before it enters memory, RAG pipelines, or execution tools.
- Block high-risk file types by default: executables, scripts, archives, macros, and active content unless the workflow explicitly requires them.
- Patch browser engines, HTML/PDF/document parsers, sandbox images, and execution runtimes promptly.

`High-impact/regulated`:
- Require human approval before executing third-party code, generated code with external side effects, package installation, shell commands, or file operations outside a temporary workspace.
- Use ephemeral execution environments with network restrictions, CPU/memory/time limits, read-only base images where practical, and central log export before teardown.
- Prohibit agents from autonomously navigating the public web for state-changing workflows unless the domain set, data handling, and prompt-injection controls are explicitly reviewed.

### 3.5 Action Trace, Monitoring, and Incident Response

`Baseline`:
- Produce an agent action trace that records decisions relevant to security without storing unnecessary raw sensitive content.
- Correlate model calls, retrieval events, memory writes, tool invocations, policy decisions, approvals, downstream actions, and final output.
- Alert on abnormal tool sequences, repeated policy denials, new tool combinations, unexpected memory writes, cross-tenant attempts, high token/request spend, and behavior drift after model or prompt changes.
- Keep raw prompts, context, tool payloads, and scratchpads out of normal logs; use minimized metadata and redacted fields.

`High-impact/regulated`:
- Maintain runbooks for data leakage, runaway agent, malicious tool use, poisoned memory/RAG source, compromised tool credential, and unsafe state-changing action.
- Test kill switch and rollback paths before launch and after major runtime/tool changes.
- Exercise incident timelines using actual log fields; a runbook is not ready if responders cannot reconstruct who or what caused a downstream action.

## 4. Verification

Required evidence:
- agent inventory entry with autonomy profile, owner, tools, memory stores, identities, and data classes;
- policy matrix: `who/what/can-do` for each tool and memory source;
- action trace schema and sample redacted trace;
- sandbox configuration for browser/file/code tools;
- memory retention and deletion policy;
- approval and kill-switch drill results for high-impact agents.

Negative tests:
- prompt injection tries to call a forbidden tool and is blocked by policy;
- retrieved document instructs the agent to ignore policy and cannot override tool authorization;
- user from tenant A cannot retrieve or act on tenant B data through memory, tools, or delegated agents;
- write action cannot execute without preview and confirmation;
- serialized checkpoint contains no active tokens or secrets;
- browser tool cannot reach cloud metadata, internal admin services, or unapproved external domains;
- code execution cannot access host filesystem, production credentials, or unrestricted network egress;
- multi-agent delegation preserves the original authorization context.

Operational signals:
- percentage of tool calls with policy decision logged;
- approval coverage for high-impact actions;
- denied tool calls per 1k sessions;
- memory write rejection rate and sensitive-data detections;
- mean time to kill runaway agents, target `<=60s`;
- behavior drift alerts after model, prompt, tool, or memory-policy changes.

## 5. Review Decision

| Severity | Agent condition | Required action |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Agent can autonomously perform irreversible, financial, administrative, cross-tenant, or external-disclosure actions without policy enforcement and approval | Block release |
| Critical | Execution/browser tool can reach production credentials, host filesystem, cloud metadata, or internal network by default | Block release and isolate runtime |
| High | Memory/checkpoints can persist active credentials, secrets, or regulated data without retention and deletion controls | Block high-impact workflows until fixed |
| High | Multi-agent workflow loses original authorization context or allows privilege escalation through delegation | Block release for privileged workflows |
| High | Action traces cannot reconstruct high-impact downstream actions | Fix before production launch |
| Medium | Inventory or policy matrix is incomplete for read-only or low-impact agents | Track remediation with owner and due date |
| Medium | Behavior drift monitoring is missing after model/prompt changes | Require compensating review and test evidence |
| Low | Prompt, tool, or memory metadata lacks consistent naming but does not affect access or logging | Fix opportunistically |

Release is approved only when the agent has bounded autonomy, explicit policy enforcement, safe memory handling, isolated execution surfaces, usable forensic traces, and tested kill-switch behavior.
