# Product Security Playbook

This repository is a working collection of product security documents, including architecture review checklists, Kubernetes hardening playbooks, and security overviews.

## Repository Status

This repository is a working security knowledge base, not a finished reference.

The content evolves over time based on practical work:
- Existing documents are regularly reviewed and updated
- New materials are added incrementally
- Documents should be treated as work in progress

The guidance reflects accumulated engineering experience, not immutable standards.

## Authorship Note

Not every document here was written from scratch by one person.

Some sections compile and adapt existing practices, references, and public knowledge, with additional analysis, edits, and implementation context.

Treat this repository as curated working material rather than purely original standalone writing.

## Contributions

Feel free to use, adapt, and extend this repository.

PRs are welcome if you want to improve existing materials or add new ones.
